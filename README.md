<h1>AutoSurvey</h1>
Worried about applying for a class? I was, before I made this.<br>
<p>
    This is a personal hobby project just for me. So it is able to survey automatically only in <a href="http://u.jjrss.com/">진진리서치</a>.
    So ignore the advertisement-like words up there XD

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Selenium: `pip install selenium` <br>
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a> (Or whatever)

<h2>Usage</h2>
``python AutoSurvey.py <Survey Number> <Private Key> <Your Selection(in number)>``
